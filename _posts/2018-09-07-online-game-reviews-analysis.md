# Understand gamer behaviour by analysing online game reviews (using AI)


<br/>

The world we live in has, of late, missed being in action, courtesy strong diplomatic ties among all nations, but it sure hasn’t stopped the citizens to wage battles of their own, across virtual regions unknown to be existing on Earth, with no one interested in putting an end to it. Sounds familiar, doesn’t it? Well, that’s what Gaming sounds like these days.

Few would defer from the fact that playing video games has taken over the minds of the so-called Gen-Y over the last two decades. And as a result, it has brought a head-scratching situation for those who design these games: enabling a perfect User-Experience Mechanism. Now, they don't only have to think about the game concept and content but read into the minds of the players who are going to play the game. This has inspired many game companies to start developing effective user research practices while developing newer versions of the game(s).

In plain sight, this is a particular discipline of design, centered around the psychology of the end-user or in layman terms, the player(s) and their behaviours, thought process and capabilities. One can use such a research to ensure that the players' minds are populated with curated experiences and then observe their thinking processes coupled with data-collection, an iterative design process, and a bunch of real-time testing of testing with real players.

## Game Research: Some effective techniques

<br/>

The best and also the worst thing about Game User research methods is that none of them is a perfect fit for every problem, rather it is a matter of applicability of the method(s). Here are a few tried-and-tested techniques for Gamer Research:

1. Think-aloud protocol - This refers to observations where “the players are asked to talk about what they are thinking as they play through the game”

2. Interviews - where the players share their thoughts on a series of questions that relate to their experience with the game to the researchers.

3. Heuristics - an evaluation consisting of judging how an interface complies with a set of recognized usability principles. i.e. this is more like some kind of User Acceptance testing.

4. Questionnaires (or surveys) - because they are by far the sources of large volumes of self-reported data from many different players.

5. Play testing - a technique that allows researchers to understand early and live reactions of players towards a ‘playable’ version of the game.

## Barriers to Game User Analysis

<br/>

But, there are barriers to performing free-hand Game User analysis as well, and we list them down here:

A. Teams/players performing the analysis end up becoming ‘too close’ to their project(s); and hence, it is difficult for them to play or perceive the game as a real player would. This can lead to bias, needless iteration, or failing to recognize where the experiential loopholes exist.

B. Designing instructions, prompts and ‘accommodating’ non-expert players to your school of thought is difficult because unlike you ( who might be a gaming pro ), others might not be an expert in the game. There might be a situation where you end up making a game that is good for no one.

C. If we observe players interact with our games in real time, it is very difficult for curbing their emotions as they play. This is true for both - assessing their moment-to-moment feelings, or even in considering their engagement over days, weeks, months.

D. There isn't an absolute right time to ‘check’ the player experience. This reluctance often results in teams putting off essential feedback-gathering processes until far too late in development. This risks late-flowering flaws being too complex, too expensive, or too far-reaching to address.

These are some indications on how one can start and perform Game User analysis on an individual level. But there is a need to discuss the kind of reviews that the users post and the impact that they have on other users' mind. For example, what happens when an irresponsible user copies and pastes reviews from one site to another? Since there is no problem of copyrights, he/she can get away with it but the credibility of the website takes a huge hit. And that's something to keep a check on.

## Grounded Theory : The Messiah to game analysis

<br/>

This is where the knowledge of Grounded theory comes in to play: It helps build a theoretical framework by performing an analysis on a rich and qualitative data source. It also helps in maintaining and enhancing the richness of the data scraped out from the reviews by answering the important 'how' and 'why' questions. the basic process is to break down the data via a coding process and grouping of smaller pieces of it into groups and categories. Towards the end of the analysis,  the end-users can be explained about how and why a certain topic has been described in a particular fashion. It is very different from analyzing a quantitative data source in a way that in case of the latter, it is known how often a feature is discussed, while in case of the former, the need to address a certain feature is brought under scrutiny. On a lighter note, we can see that this theory favors Simple living and High thinking!

The RVA ( Review Analysis Methodology ) is an application of this Grounded theory and consists of the following steps: Planning, Data Collection, Analysis, and Reporting. All the terms are self-explanatory and the user needs to absorb them on his/her own. This entire process takes a long time in most of the cases ( depends on the size of review data, which is generally huge ) and quite reasonably, there is an option to automate the entire process. In fact, here is why analyzing these reviews manually may not be very helpful:

1. Cost: Considering shelling out least wage and the fact that an average person can process 50 items of unstructured data an hour, it costs $145,000 to have someone read through and categorize text for one million items.

2. Time: In another study, it was found that one person can process 400 unstructured data elements in an eight-hour period. In this manner, going through one million comments would take 2,500 days to process, i.e., roughly under seven years. (To add perspective, Yelp users post 37,987,200 reviews per day. TripAdvisor has 200 million posts and counting.) By the time we can analyze this much data, it would be late to make any meaningful change on the back of it. Now you know why "Time is Money"!

3. Errors: Studies suggest that humans have an average accuracy rate of around 80%. They tend to make mistakes and are more often than not, less efficient while coding than what is expected out of them.

4. Inflexibility: While analyzing these reviews , one can not accommodate new categories or codes, and are even less likely to include progressive scenarios that arise out of posing "what if" kind of questions.

The process of automating these reviews can be categorized into two broad categories: Text analysis and Sentiment analysis.

Text analysis is all about parsing texts to extract and quantify the topics and parameters mentioned in the text suitable to human understanding. The purpose of text analysis is to create sets of structured data out of heaps of unstructured, heterogeneous documents. When textual sources are turned into data, they can be further used for deriving valuable information, discovering patterns, managing, using and reusing content, searching beyond keywords and more. The entire process of analyzing the text can be broken into several sub-processes - Named entity recognition (use of statistical techniques to identify named text features: people, organizations, place names etc), Disambiguation (use of contextual clues - for an instance, FPS could be First Person Shooter or Frames Per Second!), Co-reference (identification of noun phrases and other terms that refer to the same object.) to name a few.

While Sentiment analysis is a part of Text Analysis itself, it follows a much more sophisticated operational strategy: it tries to identify and extract opinions within a text. Usually, besides identifying the opinion, these systems extract attributes of the expression, i.e.:

1. Polarity: whether the speaker expresses a positive or negative opinion,

2. Subject: the thing that is being talked about,

3. Opinion holder: the person, or entity that expresses the opinion.

Sentiment Analysis is very powerful considering that can be utilized to assess emotions, opinions, and views of people up to very fine levels. To achieve this, following algorithms are referred:

a. Rule-based systems that perform sentiment analysis based on a set of manually crafted rules such as stemming, part of speech tagging etc.

b. Automatic systems that rely on machine learning techniques such as Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines to train and learn from data.

c. Hybrid systems that combine both rule-based and automatic approaches.

As convenient and effective this automation is, it always displays some ironical and erratic results. It is very well known that Sentiment analysis fails miserably at detecting Sarcasm or Neutral comments. For example, look at some possible answers to the question "How did you find that game I recommended you?" below.

Oh man, playing that game takes one hell of grinding for sure!


I just loved it, and you know what, I couldn’t believe that it even ran on my horrible PC!

What sentiment can you gather from the responses above? If you have listened to the first response so many times, you would definitely have said negative, right? The problem here is lack of any textual cue that will teach a machine that negative sentiment even if more often than not, "hell" and "grinding" correspond to negative texts.

How about the second response? In this context, the sentiment might be a positive one, but I'm sure you the model would have a hard time figuring out that “couldn’t believe” actually is adding positivity to the entire statement. Quite ironic, isn't it?

Another limitation in the case of Sentiment analysis is that machine learning is isolated, and humans don’t learn in isolation.

So it’s critical for humans to apply the prior knowledge they’ve gained from their experience and then pass the baton to the ML models to bring out the best results.

## Game Analysis Solutions @Freetext AI

<br/>

That said, We at Freetext AI imply the same strategy of a sort of a cross-over between human expertise and specialized ML models to drive pretty effective data insights of the customer reviews and make it available for taking up with interested clients. To be specific, Freetext AI enables clients to make sense of unstructured textual customer feedback for their respective businesses and brands. And for us, Gaming reviews are a key area of focus.

We have learned that understanding gamer feedback is a big deal for Gaming Studios across the globe. They have in-house User Research teams that study and research gamers (specifically how a gamer interacts with or perceives a game) to understand what's going well or wrong with any given game. We may use the results of such studies to inform future development of the game, fix bugs and generally to improve the gaming experience as a whole. A variety of techniques are being used to get into the heads of the gamers, but we are sure that there is still a lot of room for improvement.

For starters, we believe that the high-end approaches these gaming studios take for collecting the reviews - surveys and in-house observation of gamers can be re-visited. And so, what we do is visit popular gaming review sites like Metacritic, Steam, etc that hold a massive chunk of real-time Gaming reviews - available as soon as the game launches! And if you were to believe us, these sites are like gold-dust when it comes to genuine reviews by the gamers, since there is no monitoring upon them and they are at their free will to literally write to their heart’s content. And that’s where our softwares and the teams associated with them break our heads at, day in and day out!

We provide the necessary tools which are available round the clock to analyze game reviews published at these sites at scale and in an enhanced manner for both reviewers and Business firms to gain the complete sense of what's happening. So that means no more fretting over firing questions to people on gunpoint (not literally, of course!), and no need for holding back your entire development process over a couple of MCQs.

As they say in Gaming terms, We’ve got your territory covered on this one!
